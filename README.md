This file contains information about the comparisons in the first part of the assignment.
Databases and spreadsheets are both used to store and manage datasets, and there are advantages and disadvantages to using both. But the main difference between them is how they store and process this data.

 DBMS and Advantages
•	It is a collection of inter – related data.
•	It stores and retrieve the data.
•	It provides support for data organizing and selecting.
•	DBMS capacity is only limited by the computer.
•	It is more towards the linkage and organization of data.
•	It can do simple calculations.
•	Efficient data handling.
•	Multi-user Access.
•	Design to fulfill the need for small and large businesses.
•	Remove redundancy and ıntegrity.
•	Expensive. But in long term Total Cost of Ownership is cheap.
•	Easy to implement complicated transactions.
•	Offers Data Integrity and Security.
•	Provide data integrity.
•	Much more powerful and manageable when handling large amounts of information.
•	Reduce duplication.
•	Minimise irregularities.
•	Good for long-term storage of records that are subject to changes.
•	Large storage capacity.
•	Can provide complex report.
Disadvantage of DBMS
•	Cost of Hardware and Software of a DBMS is quite high which increases the budget of your organization.
•	Most database management systems are often complex systems, so the training for users to use the DBMS is required.
•	In some organizations, all data is integrated into a single database which can be damaged because of electric failure or database is corrupted on the storage media.
•	Use of the same program at a time by many users sometimes lead to the loss of some data.
•	DBMS can’t perform sophisticated calculations.
•	Learning database languages such as SQL can be labor and time intensive.
•	Planning databases often requires extensive planning and may slow the research process down.
•	Data stored in proprietary database software can be diffucult to convert to other formats.
•	Needs a moderate to high level of skills to set up, use and maintain it.
•	More rigid – not as easy to make structural changes once the database is set up.
•	Not usually as intuitive as a spreadsheet.
Advantages of Spreadsheets:

•	They are easy  to learn and many people already know many of their function.
•	They provide flexible and customizable features for organizing and analyzing data.
•	Mant other applications and coding languages work seamlessly with data stored in spreadsheets.
•	Data in spreadsheets can be easily converted into csv or tabular formats that are perfectly suited for long term storage and sharing.
•	Quick to set up
•	Easy to use
•	Flexible
•	Inexpensive
•	Automatically recalculate formulas
•	You can easily produce stylish charts and graphs
•	You can produce tables of summarised data
•	Sorting and filtering
•	Cell formatting
•	It ıs and electronic graph sheets with rows and columns
	It stores and analyzes the data.
	It provides support for complex calculations.
	Spreadsheets hold limited amount of information.
	It more towards calculations
	It can do simple data organizing and selecting.
	It’s cheape


Disadvantages of Spreadsheet

•	Limited capacity
•	Lack of controls
•	No data backup
•	Diffucult to troubleshoot or test
•	Regulatory compliance challenges
•	Diffucult data security
•	Potential for errors and untimeliness in reporting
•	Business continuity
•	Limited control over data integrity and format
•	Some proprietary spreadsheet software hâce limits on the amount of data they, can house.
•	Most importantly, it’s easy for humans to introduce errors into data through mistakes like accidentally overwrştşng cells or by recording data in non-normalized structures.
•	Not ideal for long-term data storage
•	Only offer simple query options
•	Don’t guard data integrity
•	Offer little or no protection from data corruption
•	Can make some links between different pieces of information but it’s limited.
•	Can add text but only 255 characters in each cell
•	Inefficient data handling.
•	It does not support multi-user Access.
•	It only limited to smaller DBMS system
•	Redundancy and Integrity issues
•	Not support for complicated transaction

Due to the features I wrote above, it will be more convenient for us to use a database management system, taking into account the needs of our company.
